### **Description: Tkinter Student Progress Report Application**  

This Python program uses **Tkinter** to create a GUI-based **Student Progress Report** system. It allows users to enter a student's name and marks for four subjects (**Hindi, English, Math, and Science**). After clicking the **"Done"** button, the program calculates:  

- **Total Marks** (sum of all subject scores)  
- **Percentage** (total marks out of 400)  
- **Division** based on percentage:  
  - 60% and above → **1st Division**  
  - 50% to 59.99% → **2nd Division**  
  - 33% to 49.99% → **3rd Division**  
  - Below 33% → **Fail**  

The results are displayed in a **message box** using `askokcancel()`.  

### **Features:**  
✔️ User-friendly Tkinter interface  
✔️ Real-time input for student name and subject marks  
✔️ Automated calculation of total, percentage, and division  
✔️ Simple and clear result display in a pop-up window  

This project is useful for **schools or individuals** who need a quick student performance report. 🚀
